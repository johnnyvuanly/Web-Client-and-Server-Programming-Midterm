                <ul>
                    <li>Enter the name of the Pokémon card. If you are unable to find your EX or GX type cards, type in the name of 
                    the Pokémon along with a dash inbetween the type for example "Blaziken-EX." </li>
                
                    <li>To see which set your Pokémon card is from, check the bottom of the card for a symbol. This is typically located at the bottom left or bottom 
                    right of the card. If it is an older card the set symbol might be located towards the middle of the card, underneath the card art. After finding the
                     symbol, match it with one of the symbols found <i><a href="https://cardmavin.com/pokemon/pokemon-card-set-symbols">here</a></i> and type the set name. 
                     If you see promo black star, you do <b>not</b> need to enter the set. Just skip that and simply enter the promo number next to the star symbol like "BW45."</li>

                    <li>Lastly enter the first number next to the set symbol. For example if you see "022/192", you'll just enter 22 for the number. Again if you have a
                    promo card just enter the promo number next to the black star like "DP24."</li>
