        <h1>Pokémon TCG</h1>

        <h2>Check whether or not your card is standard legal for tournament play</h2>

        <p>To see which set your Pokémon card is from, check the bottom of the card for a symbol. This is typically 
            located at the bottom left or bottom right of the card. After finding the symbol, match it with one of 
            the symbols found <i><a href="https://cardmavin.com/pokemon/pokemon-card-2set-symbols">here</a></i> and type the
             set name below. Next to the symbol you'll find a number like "20/214" then enter the first number below. 
             In this case you would enter 20. This means that the card you have is number 20 of 214 from the set.</p>

        <label for="card">Enter the card number next to the symbol:</label><input id="card" name="card">

        <label for="set">Enter the set the card is from:</label><input id="set" name="set">
